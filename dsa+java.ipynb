    "**Linked List for Transportation Schedule Tracking** –A linked list data structure helps manage transportation timetables by maintaining an ordered and readily updatable list of arrival and departure times. This allows for timely updating when timetables are changed, delivering accurate and real-time tracking of public transportation services.\n",

    "1. BINARY HEAP DATA STRUCTURE\n",
    "   The conditions for a binary heap data structure are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Complete Binary Tree Property(Known as Strutural Property)\n",
    "          All levels of the tree are completely filled except possibly the last level.\r",
    "          The last level is filled from left to right without any gaps. # You should go to the next level when the previous level is completed filled.You should fill from left to right.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   3. Heap Property (Known as Ordering Property)\n",
    "          The values in the nodes must satisfy the heap property, which depends on the type of heap:\n",

    "    WHY DO WE USE MIN HEAP DATA STRUCTURE IN OUR PROJECT INSTEAD FOR MAX HEAP?\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Min heap ensures that the event which is at earlist is always at the root.\n",
    "   2. Dijkstra algorithim uses a min heap to extract the vertex with the smallest distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. LINKED LIST DATA STRUCTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "   A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element (often called a \"node\") contains a reference (or        link) to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists use nodes to store\n",
    "   elements which are    not stored in contiguous memory locations.\n",

    "   </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "   ADVANTAGES OF USING LINKED LIST:\n",
    "   1. Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically, allowing for efficient memory usage.\n",
    "   2. Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing entries can be done without shifting elements, which is more efficient than in an array.\n"
